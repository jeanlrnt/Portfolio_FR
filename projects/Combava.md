# Summary

This project was led by [Benjamin PELAUDEIX](http://github.com/Benjamin-Pelaudeix), [LÃ©o THINNES](http://github.com/leothinnes) and [myself](http://jeanlrnt.github.io). We worked in order to meet the request of a fictitious client for the man-machine interface module of our Computer Science DUT.

The request consisted in creating a "one page" in order to allow the association to propose an online registration for its tastings all around France. It was also necessary to keep the graphic charter of David's Lemonade.

This project is available at the following address: [jeanlaurent.me/Combava](http://jeanlrnt.github.io/Combava)

You can learn more about at my [GitHub repository](http://GitHub.com/jeanlrnt/Bibliotheque).
