# Summary

Project carried out during the object-oriented design module. Based on
the idea of Isabelle Blasquez, professor at the IUT of Limousin. This
game has been made thanks to a test-driven development approach.

SpaceInvaders is a game in which the player controls a spaceship with a
cannon in the game space. He can only go from right to left at the bottom
of the screen. In front of him, at the top of the game space, enemies are
shooting at him. These enemies move from right to left and move down a notch
at the end of each round trip. If the player kills all the enemies, a new
wave appears.

The goal of the game is to survive as many enemy waves as possible. In
this game, winning is impossible, so you have to lose as late as possible.

You can learn more about at my [GitHub repository](http://GitHub.com/jeanlrnt/SpaceInvaders).
