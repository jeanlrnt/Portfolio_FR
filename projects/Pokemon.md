# Summary

Project carried out to put into practice the basics of
object-oriented programming in java. This project is
"non-graphical". Indeed, it was central in this project
to put into practice the knowledge of object-oriented development
rather than graphical skills.

It is therefore possible for the player to interact with his
environment (capturing, releasing Pokemon, interacting with them,
but also collecting food and giving it to the Pokemon), but also
to make the Pokemon interact with each other by making them fight
against each other.

You can learn more about at my [GitHub repository](http://GitHub.com/jeanlrnt/Pokemon).
