# Summary

This project consists in creating a C/C++ program to manage a library.

This project on will have no interface other than the console.
It is therefore essential to be able to navigate between
the different "modules" using menus and sub-menus. This segmentation is arbitrary.

The following are set up:

- A differentiated management of books and authors.
- A backup system.
- A reset system.
- The complete language change (English/French).
- A classification of the errors recorded on a separate file.

You can learn more about at my [GitHub repository](http://GitHub.com/jeanlrnt/Bibliotheque).
